# Phase 3: Interactive Visualization

## Overview
This phase focuses on creating an interactive, performant, and user-friendly visualization of the Stellaris technology tree.

## Requirements
- **Large Tree Support**: Efficiently handle 2,000+ technologies with smooth zooming and panning.
- **Responsive Minimap**: Provide a minimap for easy navigation and orientation within the large tech tree.
- **Interactive Selection**: Selecting a technology highlights its prerequisites and their connections with directional arrows.
- **Search Functionality**: Implement a robust search feature that centers the view on selected search results.
- **Filtering and Redrawing**: Allow filtering of technologies by area, category, and tier, with optional dynamic redrawing to optimize space.
- **UX Best Practices**: Include tooltips, loading indicators, clear error messages, and responsive design.

## Technical Components
- **Visualization Library**: Use D3.js or similar for scalable vector graphics (SVG) rendering.
- **Frontend Framework**: React for component-based UI development.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive and modern styling.
- **Bundler**: Vite for efficient frontend development and bundling.

## Implementation Details
- **Zoom and Pan**: Implement smooth zooming and panning using D3.js zoom behavior.
- **Minimap**: Create a responsive minimap that updates in real-time as the user navigates.
- **Highlighting**: Use SVG paths with directional arrows to clearly indicate technology relationships.
- **Search and Filter**: Develop intuitive search and filter components that dynamically update the visualization.
- **Performance Optimization**: Employ lazy loading, caching, and efficient data structures to maintain performance.

## Testing
- Unit tests for individual components.
- Integration tests for interactive behaviors.
- Performance tests with large datasets.
- Accessibility and cross-browser compatibility tests.

## UX Considerations
- Ensure intuitive navigation and interaction.
- Provide clear visual feedback for user actions.
- Maintain responsiveness across various devices and screen sizes.

## Viewport vs SVG Implementation Guidance

To avoid common pitfalls in viewport and SVG implementation, follow these specific guidelines:

- **Viewport Management**:
  - Clearly separate viewport logic (zooming, panning) from SVG rendering logic.
  - Use D3.js zoom behavior to manage viewport transformations efficiently.
  - Maintain a clear distinction between viewport coordinates and SVG coordinates.

- **SVG Structure**:
  - Structure SVG elements hierarchically, grouping related elements logically.
  - Apply transformations at the group (`<g>`) level rather than individual elements to optimize performance.
  - Ensure SVG elements are responsive and scale appropriately with viewport transformations.

- **Performance Considerations**:
  - Minimize DOM manipulations by batching updates and using virtual DOM techniques where possible.
  - Implement lazy rendering and culling techniques to render only visible elements within the viewport.
  - Use efficient data binding and update patterns provided by D3.js.

- **Debugging and Maintenance**:
  - Clearly document the viewport and SVG coordinate systems and transformations.
  - Provide debugging tools or overlays to visualize viewport boundaries and transformations during development.

Following these guidelines will help maintain a clean, performant, and maintainable implementation of viewport and SVG interactions.

### Backend Integration Points

- **Stage 5**: Begin integration with the real backend API during the Search and Filtering stage.
- Replace the mock data with actual API calls to fetch technology data.
- Implement proper error handling for API requests.
- Consider implementing a caching layer to optimize repeated data fetching.

### Performance Testing with Real Data

- **Stage 6**: Use the complete dataset from the backend for performance testing.
- Ensure the visualization can handle the full technology tree (2,000+ technologies).
- Optimize rendering and interaction based on real-world data patterns.

This structured approach ensures each stage is independently testable, facilitating easier debugging and maintenance.

This design ensures a robust, scalable, and user-friendly interactive visualization for the Stellaris Tech Tree Viewer.
